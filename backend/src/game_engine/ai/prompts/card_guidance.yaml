# TOYS - Combat Units

Archer:
  trap: "0 STR = CANNOT tussle or direct_attack! Defensive only (blocks opponent attacks)"
  reminder: "Only action: activate_ability (1CC, repeatable). Reduce enemy STA to 0 = auto-sleep. Knight (3 STA) = 3 activations"
  threat: "MEDIUM"

Paper Plane:
  trap: "WEAK in combat (2/2/1) - will LOSE to most toys! But has PASSIVE bypass ability"
  reminder: "With opponent toys present: Use direct_attack (2 CC) instead of tussling! Only tussle if you'll WIN (calculate combat first). Bypass works automatically - no activate_ability needed"
  threat: "MEDIUM"

Wizard:
  trap: "Turn 1: costs 2 CC, leaves 0 CC. Can't tussle with Wizard alone!"
  reminder: "Tussles cost 1 CC while in play (not 2). Play before tussling"
  threat: "MEDIUM"

  reminder: "Remove early or opponent snowballs CC advantage"
  threat: "HIGH"

  reminder: "Play actions first to fill sleep zone, then play Dream cheap"
  threat: "MEDIUM"

Beary:
