# Frontend Development Kickoff (Archived)

This file has been archived. The original content described the early
frontend kickoff plan and example payloads when the backend first
became feature-complete.

The current, maintained frontend documentation lives in:

- `docs/development/FRONTEND_OVERVIEW.md`
- `docs/development/ARCHITECTURE.md`

Refer to those documents for up-to-date information about the
frontend codebase and API contracts.
