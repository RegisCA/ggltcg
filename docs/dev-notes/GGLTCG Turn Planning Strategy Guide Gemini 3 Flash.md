# GGLTCG Turn Planning Strategy Guide

## Core Winning Principle

**Minimize the average CC cost of sleeping opponent cards.** The most efficient strategies reduce the total CC spent to sleep all 6 opponent cards. Every decision should be evaluated against CC efficiency and board control.

***

## Turn Planning Framework

### Phase 1: Threat Assessment

Evaluate all opponent cards currently in play to understand immediate and ongoing threats.

#### 1.1 Immediate Combat Threats

- **Can they tussle my cards right now?**
    - Compare their Speed/Strength/Stamina vs. my cards in play
    - Identify which of my cards are vulnerable
    - Determine what limited them last turn: insufficient CC or weak stats?
- **Can they direct attack my hand?**
    - Do they have cards like Paper Plane that bypass defenders?
    - Do I have enough defenders in play?
    - How many cards remain in my hand vs. theirs?


#### 1.2 Effect-Based Threats

- **What continuous effects are active?**
    - Stat buffs (Ka, Demideca, Drum, Violin)
    - Economic effects (Belchaletta, Gibbers, Hind Leg Kicker)
    - Protection effects (Beary, Sock Sorcerer)
- **Which effects are restricting my options?**
    - Immunity preventing my Action cards (Beary, Sock Sorcerer = CRITICAL)
    - Cost modifiers limiting my plays (Gibbers)
    - Stat boosts making tussles unfavorable (Ka, Wizard combo)


#### 1.3 Threat Prioritization

Rank threats from highest to lowest priority:

1. **CRITICAL**: Sock Sorcerer (blocks all effect-based removal), Wizard (enables multi-sleep turns), Gibbers (economic disruption)
2. **HIGH**: Belchaletta (CC engine), Raggy (free tussles), Umbruh (opponent telegraphing aggression), Knight (guaranteed tussle wins), Twist in hand
3. **MEDIUM**: Ka, Ballaber, Dream, stat buffers, Paper Plane
4. **LOW**: Stand-alone cards without active effects or weak stats

***

### Phase 2: Resource Inventory

Survey all available tools and calculate potential action sequences.

#### 2.1 Action Cards Assessment

Identify game-state modifiers in hand:

- **CC Generation**: Rush (+2 CC), Surge (+1 CC), Umbruh (when sleeped)
- **Board Removal**:
    - Drop (1 target, triggers sleep effects)
    - Clean (all toys, triggers sleep effects)
    - Archer ability (precision stamina removal, 1 CC per stamina)
- **Cost Reduction**: Wizard (tussles cost 1 CC instead of 2)
- **Theft/Control**: Twist (steal opponent's best toy)
- **Bounce/Return**: Toynado (reset board), Jumpscare (tempo play without sleep trigger)
- **Combat Modifier**: VeryVeryAppleJuice (+1/+1/+1 this turn only)
- **Recursion**: Wake, Sun, That was fun

**For each Action card, consider:**

- Does this change subsequent action costs?
- Does this enable combos I couldn't do otherwise?
- What's the total CC investment vs. board impact?


#### 2.2 Toy Cards Assessment

**Cards already in play:**

- What can they tussle successfully right now?
- Do they have activated abilities? (Archer stamina removal)
- What continuous effects are they providing?

**Cards in hand:**

- Offensive capabilities (stats, combat modifiers)
- Combo potential with cards in play
- Alternative costs (Ballaber, Dream)
- Special abilities (Knight auto-win, Raggy free tussles, Paper Plane direct attack)


#### 2.3 Action Sequence Calculation

**For each viable removal target, calculate paths:**

- **Tussle path**: Play cost + tussle cost (usually play cost + 2 CC, or +1 CC with Wizard)
- **Archer path**: Archer play cost (0 CC) + stamina removal cost (1 CC per stamina)
- **Action card path**: Card cost + any setup required
- **Combo path**: Total cost of multiple-card sequences (e.g., VeryVeryAppleJuice + tussle, or Archer + finishing tussle)

**Track total CC budget:**

- Starting CC (usually 4, or 6 with Belchaletta)
- CC gained this turn (Rush, Surge, triggered effects)
- CC spent on plays and actions
- CC remaining for additional actions or direct attacks

***

### Phase 3: Threat Mitigation Strategy

If you cannot eliminate all threats with available CC, prioritize control.

#### 3.1 Priority Elimination

- **Remove highest-threat cards first** (see Phase 1.3 prioritization)
- **Remove immunity/protection cards first** if they're blocking your removal options
- **Remove CC engines** (Belchaletta) before they generate more advantage
- **Remove cost reducers** (Wizard) that enable multi-sleep turns


#### 3.2 Defensive Positioning

When threats must remain:

- **Leave the least dangerous threat behind**
    - Prefer leaving cards with weak stats or no active effects
    - Avoid leaving cards that enable combos (Ka + tussler, Wizard + anything)
- **Choose your sacrifice wisely**
    - If opponent will tussle on their turn, leave a high-stamina or high-speed defender
    - Force opponent to spend multiple tussles or play additional cards
    - **Goal**: Make them spend maximum CC to sleep minimum cards


#### 3.3 Cost Efficiency Evaluation

Before committing to a sequence:

- **Calculate opponent's likely CC cost to respond** on their turn
- Compare: "I spend X CC to sleep Y cards" vs. "They spend Z CC to sleep my cards"
- Favor sequences where you create unfavorable trades for opponent

***

### Phase 4: Offensive Opportunities

After threats are neutralized, maximize damage with remaining CC.

#### 4.1 Direct Attack Windows

- **No opponent cards in play = safe to attack hand**
- **Paper Plane in play = can attack even with opponent defenders**
- **Maximum 2 direct attacks per turn**


#### 4.2 CC Generation for Extra Actions

Look for "free" CC to enable one more action:

- Surge (0 CC cost, +1 CC) = enables 1 CC action
- Rush (1 CC cost, +2 CC) = net +1 CC
- Umbruh in play being sleeped = +1 CC
- Hind Leg Kicker in play = +1 CC per card played

**Example sequence:**

- 1 CC remaining, Surge in hand, weak toy in play
- Play Surge (0 CC, gain 1 CC) → 2 CC total
- Direct attack twice → win if opponent has 1 card in hand


#### 4.3 Tempo Maximization

- Play cards that generate ongoing value (Belchaletta, Hind Leg Kicker)
- Set up combos for next turn (play Wizard + strong tussler)
- Position cards with protection (Beary, Sock Sorcerer) to lock in advantage

## Decision-Making Process

### For each turn, execute in order:

1. **Assess** all threats (Phase 1)
2. **Inventory** all resources and calculate sequences (Phase 2)
3. **Generate** all viable action sequences
4. **Evaluate** each sequence:
    - Total CC cost
    - Threats eliminated
    - Board state after sequence
    - Opponent's likely response options
    - CC efficiency ratio
5. **Select** sequence with best outcome:
    - Prioritize: Eliminate CRITICAL threats > HIGH threats > board control > offensive damage
6. **Execute** selected sequence
7. **Exploit** remaining CC for direct attacks if board is clear

### Key Evaluation Criteria:

- **CC Efficiency**: Did I minimize CC spent per card sleeped?
- **Board Control**: Am I reducing opponent's options for their turn?
- **Tempo**: Am I forcing opponent to spend more CC than me?
- **Win Condition Progress**: Am I closer to sleeping all 6 opponent cards?

## Practical Turn Example Walkthrough

### Turn 2 - Human Player Response

**Game State:**

- My CC: 4
- Opponent's board: Knight (4/4/3), Paper Plane (2/2/1), Umbruh (4/4/4), Surge sleeped
- My hand: Archer, Paper Plane, Umbruh, Knight, Wake, Surge

**Phase 1 - Threat Assessment:**

- **Knight**: HIGH threat (auto-wins tussles on opponent's turn)
- **Paper Plane**: MEDIUM threat (can direct attack my hand)
- **Umbruh**: HIGH threat (opponent planning offensive, +1 CC when sleeped)

**Phase 2 - Resource Inventory:**

Action cards:

- Surge: 0 CC, gain 1 CC
- Wake: not needed right now

Toy cards:

- Archer: 0 CC, can remove stamina for 1 CC each
- Knight: 1 CC, auto-wins tussles on my turn
- Umbruh: 1 CC, gives 1 CC when sleeped
- Paper Plane: 1 CC, can direct attack

**Phase 3 - Calculate Sequences:**

**Option A: Knight vs Knight + tussle Paper Plane**

- Play Knight (1 CC) → 3 CC left
- Tussle Knight (2 CC) → 1 CC left, Knight eliminated
- Play Umbruh (1 CC) → 0 CC left
- Result: Knight and Umbruh in play, Paper Plane threat remains

**Option B: Archer ability path**

- Play Archer (0 CC) → 4 CC left
- Remove 1 stamina from Paper Plane (1 CC) → 3 CC left, Paper Plane sleeped
- Remove 3 stamina from Knight (3 CC) → 0 CC left, Knight sleeped
- Result: Archer in play, both threats eliminated but no CC for additional plays

**Option C: Archer + Surge + Umbruh**

- Play Archer (0 CC) → 4 CC left
- Remove 1 stamina from Paper Plane (1 CC) → 3 CC left, Paper Plane sleeped
- Remove 3 stamina from Knight (3 CC) → 0 CC left, Knight sleeped
- Play Surge (0 CC) → gain 1 CC → 1 CC total
- Play Umbruh (1 CC) → 0 CC left
- Result: Archer + Umbruh in play, both major threats eliminated

**Phase 4 - Evaluation:**

Option C is superior:

- Eliminates both critical threats (Knight, Paper Plane)
- Leaves 2 cards in play vs opponent's 1 (Umbruh)
- Archer provides ongoing removal utility
- Umbruh provides defensive bulk and CC when eventually sleeped
- Cost: 4 CC to sleep 2 cards (2 CC per card) = excellent efficiency
- Hand remaining: Paper Plane, Knight, Wake for next turn

**Selected Action:** Option C

***

## Strategic Principles Summary

1. **Always calculate CC efficiency**: Total CC spent ÷ opponent cards sleeped
2. **Threat priority matters more than stats**: Remove enablers before beaters
3. **Consider multi-turn sequences**: Some plays set up devastating next turns
4. **Force unfavorable trades**: Make opponent spend more CC than you
5. **Exploit CC generation**: Free resources enable surprise plays
6. **Tempo is king**: Controlling the board tempo often leads to victory
7. **Evaluate ALL sequences**: The non-obvious play is often the best play

***

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Playing weak cards (Paper Plane) without using them immediately for attacks
- Leaving high-value offensive cards (Knight) vulnerable on defense
- Ignoring immunity/protection threats (Sock Sorcerer, Beary)
- Wasting removal on low-priority targets when critical threats exist
- Not calculating total sequence costs before committing
- Forgetting maximum 2 direct attacks per turn limit
- Playing into Clean when opponent has 2+ cards in play
